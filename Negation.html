<h1>Negation</h1>

<p1>
Negation is applied to a concept via the prefix <i>ni-</i> applied to a <a href="Verb.html">verb</a>.

<br>
<br>
Arkan <b>ni</b>sur beer.
<br>
<i>Translated: Cruelty is <b>not</b> sexy.</i>
</p2>

<h2><i>N'</i> Contraction</h2>

<p3>
When the negation <i>ni-</i> is prepended onto a word that begins in a vowel sound, it is replaced with the contracted version, <i>n'</i>. In many dialects, this contraction is also applied to words beginning in the /h/ sound. In these cases, the /h/ is not pronounced in the negated form.

Heam <b>n'</b>esur je kor.
<br>
<i>Translated: He does <b>not</b> eat the food.</i>

<h2>With Use of Object Pronoun Prefixes</h2>

<p5>
When combined with <a href="Object_Pronoun_Prefixes.html">object pronoun prefixes</a>, Erdic negation usually comes first. Some dialects of Erdic allow object pronoun prefixes to come first when the affected verb does not begin with /h/ nor a vowel sound. However, in any dialect, negation, when combined with object pronoun prefixes, never takes the form <i>n'</i>, and instead always takes the form of <i>ni-</i>.
