<h2>Adjectivization and Regular Adjectives</h2>

<p3>
Erdic is currently undergoing a shift in which most adjectives are acquiring the <i>-t/-et</i> suffix. Adjectives with this ending are considered regular. Nouns can generally be adjectivized to act as an adjective using the <i>-t/-et</i> suffix. However, this is still not the case for many common of adjectives which have not become regular.
