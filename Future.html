<h1>Future Tense</h1>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p1>
The future tense is used to denote something that will occur in the future. This is often done using the grammatical <a href="Verbs.html">verb</a> <i>"coa,"</i> which denotes a future tense. However, the use of this verb, while common, is not universal. Some variants of Erdic choose to use the <a href="Present_Progressive.html">present progressive</a> conjugation instead.
</p1>

<h2><i>"Coa"</i> Method</h2>

<p2>
To conjugate in this way, the verb <i>"coa"</i> is conjugated as if it were the active verb, and is then proceeded by the present form of a verb.
</p2>

<p3>
<br>
<br>
<b>Coir</b> vida nevo.
<br>
<i>Translated: <b>I will</b> live again.</i>
</p3>

<h2>Present Progressive Method</h2>

<p4>
To conjugate using the present progressive, the verb suffix <i>-v</i> is tacked onto the end of the <a href="Present.html">present</a> conjugation of the verb, as shown in the table below:
